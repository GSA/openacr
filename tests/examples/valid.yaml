              level: "supports"
              notes: The back end of Drupal Core was built to be  WCAG 2.0 AA compliant and non-text content in the administration interface has a textual equivalent. Audio and video can be added to the media library, but Core does not provide tools to manage transcripts and captions/subtitles for local video and audio - Drupal issue #3002770.
  - num: "1.2.1"
    components:
      - name: "web"
        adherence:
          level: "supports"
          notes: Authors can satisfy 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded) by using text on the same page.

        adherence:
          level: "supports"
          notes: This is not explicitly defined in the documentation.

      - name: "authoring-tool"
        adherence:
          level: "supports"
          notes: There is no additional support for authors within the authoring interface to explain how this can be done.
      - num: "1.2.2"
        components:
          - name: "web"
            adherence:
              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: The file module in Core lets authors upload audio and video content, and output <audio> and <video> elements and does not support captions.

              level: "does-not-support"
              notes: Drupal does not support, let alone require users to include captions. Hard coding open captions is presently the only way to satisfy this in Core.

        adherence:
          level: "does-not-support"
