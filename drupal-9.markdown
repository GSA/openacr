## Terms

The terms used in the Conformance Level information are defined as follows:

- **Supports**: The functionality of the product has at least one method that meets the criterion without known defects or meets with equivalent facilitation.
- **Partially Supports**: Some functionality of the product does not meet the criterion.
- **Does Not Support**: The majority of product functionality does not meet the criterion.
- **Not Applicable**: The criterion is not relevant to the product.
- **Not Evaluated**: The product has not been evaluated against the criterion. This can be used only in WCAG 2.x Level AAA.

## WCAG 2.1 Report

### Table 1: Success Criteria, Level A

Notes: Drupal doesn&#x27;t make a strong distinction between the front-end &amp;amp; back-end accessibility. Many administration interfaces can be exposed to users in a more interactive site. Generally this report focuses the Conformance Level / Remarks and Explainations so that Web comments are about elements that are typically public, while Authoring Tool is typically for authors and administrators. The goal of the authoring interface is to support ATAG 2.0 AA (Part A and B). The Drupal community strives to beek up with the latest WCAG recommendation.

Conformance to the 30 criteria listed below is distributed within each category as follows:

| Conformance Level  | Web | Electronic Documents | Software | Authoring Tool |
| ------------------ | --- | -------------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Supports           | 19  | 19                   | 0        | 19             |
| Partially Supports | 2   | 0                    | 0        | 2              |
| Does Not Support   | 2   | 1                    | 0        | 2              |
| Not Applicable     | 2   | 5                    | 25       | 2              |
