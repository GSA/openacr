              Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages

            sufficientNotes:
              - Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance,
                you may have an graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to
                the next Web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally,
                it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next
                Web page. It would be more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these
                text alternatives would not be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore
                would satisfy this Success Criterion.
              - A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In
                such cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used.
                Examples can be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks,
                cross marks, and traffic signs. Their functions can be different depending
                on the context of the Web page. A check mark icon may function as "approved",
                "completed", or "included", to name a few, depending on the situation. Using
                "check mark" as text alternative across all Web pages does not help users
                understand the function of the icon. Different text alternatives can be used
                when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.
