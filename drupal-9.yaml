    notes: >-
      Drupal doesn't make a strong distinction between the front-end &amp;
      back-end accessibility. Many administration interfaces can be exposed to
      users in a more interactive site. Generally this report focuses the
      Conformance Level / Remarks and Explainations so that Web comments are
      about elements that are typically public, while Authoring Tool is
      typically for authors and administrators. The goal of the authoring
      interface is to support ATAG 2.0 AA (Part A and B). The Drupal community
      strives to beek up with the latest WCAG recommendation.

                The back end of Drupal Core was built to be  WCAG 2.0 AA

                has a textual equivalent. Audio and video can be added to the
                media library, but Core does not provide tools to manage
                transcripts and captions/subtitles for local video and audio -
