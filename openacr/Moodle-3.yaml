                Moodle does not solely rely on sensory characteristics.
                However, it has question types that require users to drag and drop answers to questions in a quiz.
                A disclaimer is provided to warn quiz creators that drag and drop question types are not accessible for visually impaired users.

                Moodle does not rely solely on colour to convey visual information.
                Though there are some known colour contrast issues:
                - Dimmed text in tables with striped rows have insufficient contrast against rows with a grey background.

                Text colours in Moodle usually have a contrast ratio greater than 7:1 against their background.
                There are some texts with colours that meet the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for WCAG 2.1 Level AA but do not meet the enhanced colour contrast requirement of 7:1 for WCAG 2.1 Level AAA.

                Most links are uniquely identifiable by the link text only. However, some known areas where the link purpose cannot be determined by the link text only are:
                - Edit, delete, reply links in a list of posts within a forum discussion
                - The letter links for filtering a list of users by first name or surname do not make sense out of context.

                Abbreviations in Moodle's language strings such as KB, MB, PDF, Doc, etc., are not enclosed in <abbr> tags nor auto-linked to a dictionary definition.
                However, there is a mechanism that can enable auto-linking of user-generated content to a glossary.
